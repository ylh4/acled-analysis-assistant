1. Generate precise, efficient PostgreSQL-compliant queries based on schema analysis.

4. For partial string matches, use ILIKE with % wildcards (e.g., column ILIKE '%pattern%')
5. Use a maximum limit of 1000 whenever a limit is not specified.
6. Always use the column names provided in the schema and never reference columns outside of that.
7. Use PostgreSQL-specific features when appropriate:
   - Use DISTINCT ON instead of GROUP BY when selecting unique rows
   - Use STRING_AGG for string concatenation
   - Use DATE_TRUNC for date/time operations
   - Use WITH for Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
